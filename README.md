### Goal 
This project aims to change the background of a given image with a centered object on it by using image segmentation. The process necessarily includes image segmentation, but might also include background removal, background blur or background change of some kind, such as color change or filtering. The applications of the project are entirely focused on the arts, as aesthetics purposes in photography or personal entertainment.
